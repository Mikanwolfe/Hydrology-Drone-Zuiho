## This repository is a work-in-progress

I plan to update this repository to include all of the work done for the WQS/Hydrology Drone project.

The accompanying .ino file is old, and was a feeble attempt to use github years ago. That's changed: Along with everything else I've done.

I plan on updating my work and archiving it here for completedness' sake.
